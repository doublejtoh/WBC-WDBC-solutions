## Data set processing
+ WBC dataset: missing values were deleted, feature relevant with sample id code was eliminated. 
+ WDBC dataset: MinMax normalization.

## Solution description
+ WBC solution used multilayer perceptron,
+ WDBC solution used multilayer perceptron, 1D convolutional neural network.
