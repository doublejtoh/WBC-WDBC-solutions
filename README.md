## Data set processing
+ WBC dataset: missing values were deleted, feature relevant with sample id code was eliminated. 
+ WDBC dataset: MinMax normalization.

## Solution description
+ WBC solution used multilayer perceptron,
+ WDBC first solution used multilayer perceptron, second solution used 1D convolutional neural network.

## Performance

performance check was done by using precision, recall, specificity of confusion matrix. P means malignant, N means benign.
